(in-package :location-costmap)

;;; The class location-costmap is central to this code, and the
;;; cost-functions it contains. The cost functions are used for
;;; sampling. The cost functions are combined by multiplying
;;; corresponding values for equal X- and Y-coordinates and finally
;;; normalizing the resulting map to be a valid probability
;;; distribution, i.e. to have a sum of 1. Therefore the values
;;; returned should never be negative, and at least some must be
;;; non-zero

;; A location costmap is a 2d grid map that defines for each x,y point
;; a cost value. It provides an API to sample random poses by
;; generating random x and y points and using further generators to
;; set the z value and the orientation of the pose.
