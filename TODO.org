* TODO update copyright statements.
  * update year (2009-2010).
  * Maybe remove names
  * Maybe remove completely
  * Maybe also dont include the passus about willow garage :)

  * Could we also get rid of the per-file notices and just provide a COPYRIGHT file or somehting. 

* TODO define-cram-test, possible to specify (:timeout nil)

  ** (:timeout nil) means no timeout at all, useful when debugging
     test case hanging.


* TODO define-cram-test, reuse 5am::*debug-on-failure*

  ** to get us into the debugger at the right spot. Might be tricky,
     and may require some thought.

  ** also how to handle errors in spawned tasks?


* TODO define-cram-test, expansion to interpret variables at run-time

  ** Talking of `*ignore-skips*', and `+n-runs+' 

  ** At the moment these are dealt with at macroexpansion time,
     so if you change them, you have to recompile all tests.


* TODO naming convention for task-local variables.

  ** I like **foo**. But that's the SBCL convention for their global
     variables extension. I'd use it nontheless.


* TODO naming convention for functions returning fluents.

  ** maybe just -FLUENT suffix? E.g. (TASK-DEAD-FLUENT <task>)?


* TODO (MAKE-INSTANCE 'TASK ...) vs (MAKE-TASK ...)

  ** When to use what? Please document appropriately.

  ** MAKE-TASK returns runnable, but _not_ yet running tasks.

  ** WITH-TAGS uses MAKE-TASK whereas TOP-LEVEL and WITH-TASK use
     MAKE-INSTANCE.


* TODO episode-knowledge.lisp uses DEFINE-TASK-VARIABLE

  ** the package CRAM-EXECUTION-TRACE should perhaps use CPL-IMPL

  ** and cram-language.asd makes this dependency not explicit 


* TODO task-local variables shared not only between tasks

  ** task-local variables do not only get their initial-binding from
     local bindings in other tasks, but in fact from any local binding
     in other _threads_.

  ** This property seems to implicitly used in TOP-LEVEL with its
     *EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE* binding.


* TODO get rid of :serial t in the .asd files

  ** make dependencies explicit.

  ** also revisit which systems depend on which. Don't forget to take
     the -test systems into account, too.

  ** *EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE* is bound locally special in TOP-LEVEL because
     its definition comes later in the build. Think of ways to
     structure the build to overcome it.

     *** Is execution-trace self-contained? Can it come before CPL?
         etc.


* DONE what's the point of WITH-TASK?

  ** and its use in WITH-PARALLEL-CHILDS? Why spawn a new task and
     then join it? To give the new task a specific name?

  ** seems wasteful

  ** The reason is that we need to at least evaporate all children
     that are still running at the end of the WITh-PARALLEL-CHILD
     form. By creating a new task, we get this behavior implicitly. Of
     course, it would be possible to handle it explicitly in
     WITH-PARALLEL-CHILD but that would introduce new bugs and
     replicate behavior that is already there. I think creating one
     more thread that does nothing but sleeping does not consume too
     many resources.


* DONE WITH-TAGS does not check for duplicates

  ** and because it expands to a LET*, SBCL won't complain either.
  
  ** It's the users fault when he uses the same tag names twice within
     the same lexical scope. This is the same as declaring variables
     with the same name, isn't it?


* TODO WITH-TAGS should expand :TAG to a common global function

  ** less code explosion; better for ICACHE and compilation speed


* TODO better name for EXECUTE-TASK-TREE-NODE

  ** it is not clear from its name that the function waits until the
     task finishes


* TODO rename TASK-RUNNING-P, and RUNNING arg in WITH-PARALLEL-CHILD

  ** call it TASK-ALIVE-P, and ALIVE instead.


* DONE fluent returned by FL-PULSED has always value T

  ** Fix FL-PULSED.1

  ** Fix WITH-PARALLEL-CHILDS.1


* TODO Fix WITH-PARALLEL-CHILDS.2

* DONE WHENEVER, WAIT-FOR, :HANDLE-MISSED-PULSES

  ** maybe fix WAIT-FOR.4

  ** fix WHENEVER.5

  ** add more test cases

  ** maybe get rid of :HANDLE-MISSED-PULSES in WAIT-FOR and WHENEVER, and
     instead introduce (fl-pulsed <fluent> :handle-missed-pulses):

     *** seems implementable.

     *** update callbacks would have to be passed the current
         (updated) pulse-count.

     *** say in case of :ALWAYS, fl-pulsed returns a fluent which:

           - knows old pulse-count of its parent fluent

           - hence knows # missed pulses

           - pulses its subscribers for #missed times.

           - this does not solve the problem that fl-pulsed needed to
             trigger the condition just after wait-for sleeps
             again. This seems hard to implement.

           

* TODO cram_reasoning: rete-holds seems to have a bug.
  
  Example: Rete net contains (desig-bound d1 'foo) and (desig-bound d2 'bar).
  (rete-holds (desig-bound ?x ?_) is fine, but (desig-bind d1 ?_) returns
  NIL twice.
