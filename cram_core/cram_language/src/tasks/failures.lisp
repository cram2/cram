(defmacro with-failure-handling (clauses &body body)
  "Macro that replaces handler-case in cram-language. This is
necessary because error handling does not work across multiple
threads. When an error is signaled, it is put into an envelope to
avoid invocation of the debugger multiple times. When handling errors,
this envelope must also be taken into account.

We also need a mechanism to retry since errors can be caused by plan
execution and the environment is highly non-deterministic. Therefore,
it is possible to use the function `retry' that is lexically bound
within with-failure-handling and causes a re-execution of the body.

When an error is unhandled, it is passed up to the next failure
handling form (exactly like handler-bind). Errors are handled by
invoking the retry function or by doing a non-local exit. Note that
with-failure-handling implicitly creates an unnamed block,
i.e. `return' can be used."
