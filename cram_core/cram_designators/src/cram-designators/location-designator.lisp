;;; Location designator resolution is based on two concepts:
;;; 
;;;  * Generation of solutions: Generator functions are functions that
;;;    take one parameter, the designator to be resolved and return a
;;;    possibly infinite (lazy) list of possible
;;;    solutions. Generators are ordered wrt. a priority value and
;;;    their solutions are appended to form the lazy list of
;;;    solutions. Lower priority means that the corresponding
;;;    generator is evaluated before generators with higher
;;;    priority. Generators are defined with the macro
;;;    DEF-LOCATION-GENERATOR.
;;;  
;;;  * Validation of solutions: After generation, a solution is
;;;    verified by a sequence of validation functions. Validation
;;;    functions are functions that get two parameters, the designator
;;;    and the generated solution.
;;;
;;;    Validation functions must return one of the following values:
;;;
;;;      - :ACCEPT the solution will be accepted unless another
;;;         validation function rejects it.
;;;
;;;      - :MAYBE-REJECT the solution will be rejected unless at least
;;;         validation function accepts it.
;;;
;;;      - :UNKNOWN the decision is completely left to the other
;;;         validation functions.
;;;
;;;      - anything else will cause the solution to be rejected.
;;;       
;;;    If the solution is accepted, it is used as the designator
;;;    reference. Otherwise, a new solution is taken from the
;;;    generated sequence of solutions and the validation functions
;;;    are executed again. The variable
;;;    *LOCATION-GENERATOR-MAX-RETRIES* indicates how often this
;;;    process can be repeated without finding a solution before an
;;;    error is signaled. Validation functions are declared with the
;;;    macro DEF-LOCATION-VALIDATION-FUNCTION
;;;
