* TODO update copyright statements.
  * update year (2009-2010).
  * Maybe remove names
  * Maybe remove completely
  * Maybe also dont include the passus about willow garage :)

  * Could we also get rid of the per-file notices and just provide a COPYRIGHT file or somehting. 

* TODO define-cram-test, possible to specify (:timeout nil)

  ** (:timeout nil) means no timeout at all, useful when debugging
     test case hanging.


* TODO define-cram-test, reuse 5am::*debug-on-failure*

  ** to get us into the debugger at the right spot. Might be tricky,
     and may require some thought.

  ** also how to handle errors in spawned tasks?


* TODO define-cram-test, expansion to interpret variables at run-time

  ** Talking of `*ignore-skips*', and `+n-runs+' 

  ** At the moment these are dealt with at macroexpansion time,
     so if you change them, you have to recompile all tests.


* TODO naming convention for task-local variables.

  ** I like **foo**. But that's the SBCL convention for their global
     variables extension. I'd use it nontheless.


* TODO naming convention for functions returning fluents.

  ** maybe just -FLUENT suffix? E.g. (TASK-DEAD-FLUENT <task>)?

  ** Maybe -F?


* TODO (MAKE-INSTANCE 'TASK ...) vs (MAKE-TASK ...)

  ** The former is implementation detail. The latter should be used.

  ** MAKE-TASK returns runnable, but _not_ yet running tasks.

  ** WITH-TAGS uses MAKE-TASK whereas TOP-LEVEL and WITH-TASK use
     MAKE-INSTANCE.


* DONE episode-knowledge.lisp uses DEFINE-TASK-VARIABLE

  ** the package CRAM-EXECUTION-TRACE should perhaps use CPL-IMPL

  ** and cram-language.asd makes this dependency not explicit 


* TODO task-local variables shared not only between tasks

  ** task-local variables do not only get their initial-binding from
     local bindings in other tasks, but in fact from any local binding
     in other _threads_.

  ** This property seems to implicitly used in TOP-LEVEL with its
     *EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE* binding.


* TODO get rid of :serial t in the .asd files

  ** make dependencies explicit.

  ** also revisit which systems depend on which. Don't forget to take
     the -test systems into account, too.


* DONE make separate package out of execution trace

  ** *EPISODE-KNOWLEDGE* is bound locally special in TOP-LEVEL because
     its definition comes later in the build. Think of ways to
     structure the build to overcome it.

     *** Is execution-trace self-contained? Can it come before CPL?
         etc.


* TODO WITH-TAGS does not check for duplicates

  ** and because it expands to a LET*, SBCL won't complain either. --tcr
  
  ** It's the users fault when he uses the same tag names twice within
     the same lexical scope. This is the same as declaring variables
     with the same name, isn't it? --lorenz

  ** The problem is that it'll compile through, and do the wrong
     thing. What's the point? checking for duplicates is SMOP. --tcr

  ** I'm with tcr. Its definately a possibly subtle bug and easy enough to
     check. -- demmeln


* TODO in the PULSE method use HASH-TABLE-VALUES

  ** We could use HASH-TABLE-VALUES instead of copying the hash table. This
     should not change the semantics but be more perdormant, right?


* TODO WITH-TAGS should expand :TAG to a common global function

  ** less code explosion; better for ICACHE and compilation speed

  ** and less confusing macro definition


* TODO better name for EXECUTE-TASK-TREE-NODE

  ** it is not clear from its name that the function waits until the
     task finishes

  ** It's coupled with the item directly above:

     *** make :TAG inside WITH-TAGS expand to something like

         (JOIN-TASK (EXECUTE-TAGGED-TASK ...))


* TODO the FIXME at the top of tasks/task.lisp.


* TODO See FIXMEs in cram-test-utilities/src/misc-utils.lisp


* TODO PARTIAL-ORDER FIXMEs

  ** could detect cyclic dependencies at compile-time.

  ** is not thread safe; if two PARTIAL-ORDER forms are used
     concurrently, which both specify the same task in (:order)
     -> two PUSHes will be executed concurrently.


* TODO ressurect RETHROWN-ERROR

  ** I took it because I wasn't sure what it was used for and if it's needed.

  ** I now see it was used for errors inside a sub task when
     propagating up its parents.

  ** Maybe call it CHILD-ERROR.


* TODO get rid of WITH-PRODUCER-CONSUMER-THREADS again

  ** test suite will only kill tasks not threads after test


* TODO get rid of *task-pprint-verbosity*

  ** no need for it. Just don't go over VALUE, but (SLOT-VALUE <fluent> 'value)


* TODO get rid of synchronization-tools

  ** do not need it after all

  ** it's used in with-task-hierarchy; might be tricky to get rid of
     it after all.


* TODO get rid of SLEEP*

  ** CL:SLEEP does not take deadlines into account

  ** hence I wrote SLEEP*, but it's not good.

  ** it works on absolute times which does not mesh well
     with context switches.

  ** I suggest get rid of it alltogether, instead introduce a special
     fluent (FL-TIMED <timeout>) which pulses after timeout expired.

     That would go well with existing stuff.

  ** Change test cases accordingly to use (WAIT-FOR (FL-TIMED ..))
     instead of SLEEP*.


* TODO get rid of LOG-EVENTS in cram-utilities.

  ** added them for debugging, forgot to remove.


* TODO improve REASON arg handling of events

  ** Instead of using "Parent did foo." make the reason be
     an implicit 

        (format nil "~A ~A." (task-abbreviated-name *current-task*) reason)

     so people can write (foo ... :reason "aborted") etc.


* TODO integrate cpl's logging stuff into roslog

  ** then remove log-msg from kipla


* TODO Synchronize parent & childs depending on variable

  ** Add :sync *some-global-flags* to uses of evaporate, suspend in
     base.lisp.
 

* TODO rename log-event to log-msg


* TODO rename log-set to log-use


* TODO docstring of define-cram-test is not up to date


* TODO get rid of *failure-behaviour* again

  ** It's not needed. User setting *break-on-signal* is enough.


* TODO get rid of *break-on-plan-failure*

  ** It's not needed. User setting *break-on-signal* is enough.


* TODO (make-task) outside top-level

  ** the error signaled should probably just say that we're outside
     top-level.


* TODO processed-pulse-count in pulse-count

  ** docstring says "pulses we have processed so far. We don't want to
     use pulse-count since it is used in wait-for to determine if
     something changed. This slot is used to compute the value"

  ** with the simplification of wait-for, it does not need (and in
    fact does not) use the pulse-count anymore.


* TODO without-scheduling in fluent code

  ** everything which was once without-termination etc I just replaced
     with without-scheduling without having reviewed the code.

  ** I think in most cases, in can actually be got rid of.


* TODO change make-fluent

  ** make it work regardless of this set-fluent-make-function stuff

  ** get rid of that set-fluent-make-function stuff; maybe use
     task-variables.

  ** make make-fluent default to the value-fluent class if not an
     explicit class is provided. Check for incompatibility if :value
     is given, but class is not a value-fluent.


* TODO anonymous fluents

  ** if possible, do _not_ make the name parameter of make-fluent be
     required. Instead default to "ANONYMOUS".

  ** see the function FLUENT in cram-test-utilities. (Which can then
     be get rid of.)


* TODO what about errors in fluent-nets

  ** e.g. (fl-funcall #'1+ <fluent>)

  ** what is if <fluent>'s value is set to :foo?


* TODO (fl-apply #'+ *fluents*) does not work

  ** bug in fl-apply


* TODO Determining good value for `+time-quantum+'

  ** add timestamp to MESSAGE in tasks/task.lisp

     Use it to see how long it takes from sending a message to its processing.

  ** count # of enters into event loop without processing msg


* TODO WHENEVER & WITH-PARALLEL-CHILDS 

  ** PAR etc. go periodically into event-loop

  ** Rather add event (:WAIT ...) which will make them really
     wait inside the event-loop.


* TODO JOIN-TASK & WAIT-FOR 

  ** Similiarly like above. The task doing the join enters event-loop
     most often in vain.

* TODO gratitious task creation in with-tags

  ** (with-tags (:tag X (par (:tag A ..) (:tag B ..)))

  ** will create PAR-#1/2 and PAR-#2/2

  ** and A, B

  ** events take some time to propagate, e.g.

       (top-level 
         (with-tags
           (par
             (:tag slave 
               (pursue (seq (sleep* 0.5) :A)
                       (seq (sleep* 1.0) :B)
                       (seq (sleep* 1.0) :C)))
             (with-task-suspended slave
               (sleep* 1.0)))))

       SLAVE <- [PAR-#2/2]  -- (:SUSPEND)

       SLAVE -> [PURSUE]    -- (:SUSPEND)

       [PURSUE-#1/2] succeeds...

       [PURSUE] teardown
 
         ignores :SUSPEND

           

* TODO cram_prolog: rete-holds seems to have a bug.
  
  Example: Rete net contains (desig-bound d1 'foo) and (desig-bound d2 'bar).
  (rete-holds (desig-bound ?x ?_) is fine, but (desig-bind d1 ?_) returns
  NIL twice.
