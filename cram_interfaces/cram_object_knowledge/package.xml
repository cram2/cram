  <description>
    CRAM internal implementation of manipulation interfaces, storing grasps etc.
    for specific object types, as well as their type hierarchy and other related
    object knowledge.
    This knowledge can also be stored in KnowRob and queried using the same
    manipulation interfaces. This package enables CRAM to function independently
    of KnowRob for people who want a lightweight system.
